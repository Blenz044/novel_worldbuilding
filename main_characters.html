    <h1>Main Characters</h1>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#itzli">Itzli</a></li>
      <li><a href="#alana">Alana</a></li>
      <li><a href="#dorian">Dorian</a></li>
      <li><a href="#merchant's son">Merchant's Son</a></li>
      <li><a href="#emperor">Emperor that has Immortals</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="itzli">Itzli</h2>
    <img src="./images/Itzli.jpg" alt="Character Art of Itzli" />
    <p>
      Throughout the story <strong>Itzli</strong> will have a negative character
      arch. In the third novel this negative character arch will be completed as
      she kills her friend. Throughout books 4 and 5 she will have a redemption
      arch where she is ultimately killed in the climax.
    </p>
    <h2 id="alana">Alana</h2>
    <img src="./images/Alana.jpg" alt="Character Art of Alana" />
    <p>
      <strong>Alana</strong> is a character that was initially going to be used
      in a different novel but I have chosen to include her in this one and
      focus on writing one novel at a time. She is a member of a barbarian tribe
      that is in the Midabour Peaks. They worship the dragon god
      <em>Kyzeot</em>. She will be a main character throughout the story.
    </p>
    <h2 id="dorian">Dorian</h2>
    <img src="./images/Dorian.jpg" alt="Character Art of Dorian" />
    <p>
      <strong>Dorian</strong> was also going to be in another book with Alana
      but I have chosen to merge those books into one. I do not know where he
      will fit into the story quite yet but I am thinking that he will still be
      from the military in some capacity.
    </p>
    <h2 id="merchant's son">Merchant's Son</h2>
    <img
      src="./images/Merchant.jpg"
      alt="Character Art of the Merchant's Son"
    />
    <p>
      This character does not have a name quite yet although he will probably be
      pivotal to world building throughout. He will be used to world build other
      parts of the world while the main characters are focused on other things.
    </p>
    <h2 id="emperor">Emperor</h2>
    <img src="./images/Emperor.jpg" alt="Character Art of the Emperor" />
    <p>
      This emperor is also un-named so far but he was initially intended on
      being a part of the the novel with <em>Dorian</em> and <em>Alana</em>. He
      is supposed to be in charge of an empire that is reminiscent of the Roman
      Empire. He is also known for killing gods and is the one that slayed the
      dragon god <em>Kyzeot</em>. He has a group of soldiers that is based on
      the immortals from Persian history.
