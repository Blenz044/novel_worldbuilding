    <h1>The Midabour Peaks</h1>
    <p>
      The <em>Midabour Peaks</em> are home to one of the 7 tribes known as the
      <em>Drakornar</em>. The Drakornar is a tribe that split off from the rest
      of the <em>Vargrundar</em> tribes once <em>Vorsha'grun</em> (City of the
      Great Lake in Drakornar) was captured by the <em>Solarii</em> (one of the
      Vargrundar tribes). The Drakonar decided to split off from the rest of the
      Vargrundar due to political differences and their refusal to worship the
      sun goddess <em>Solvara</em>. The Drakonar moved away from the lowlands
      and into the highlands to inhabit the area called the Midabour Peaks. Here
      they worship the dragon god name Kyzeot.

    <h2>Blood of Kyzeot</h2>
    <p>
      The Dragon God Kyzeot is dead by the time the novel rolls around. The
      drakonar live in seclusion up in the Midabour Peaks with the intention of
      keeping to themselves and staying out of the world's politics. The still
      have the blood of their god that they can consume to "commune" with him.
      There are rituals that their high priests can do which create more blood
      of Kyzeot to slip through the cracks in the dimensions and replenish their
      stocks. When the blood of Kyzeot is consumed, the Drakornar feel a rush of
      primal strength come over them and increases their ability to tolerate
      pain and enhances their strength as well as all their other perceptive
      sense. For a period of time they become one with the dragon god and as a
      result they frequently will blood dope by carrying around vials of the
      dragon's blood to be used when necessary. However, Consuming the blood of
      Kyzeot to them is seen as a sacred act and if anyone from another tribe
      were to do it they would be greatly offended and may become provoked. It
      is usually used sparingly and only when needed although even people of
      their own culture that don't respect thier traditions will abuse it and
      not grasp it's true potential.

    <p>
      Prior to going off on their own, the Drakornar had a different name... the
      <em>Udrakal</em>. They split off because the Udrakal and the Solarii
      didn't get along very well politically and with their beliefs. The Solarii
      worship the goddess of the sun while the Udrakal primarily worship the
      dragon god Kyzeot. Although all of the gods the tribes worship is part of
      the same pantheon each tribe has it's own primary deity that it elevates
      above the others. After the Solarii took over the City of the Great Lake
      through force, the Udrakal wanted nothing to do with the tribal coalition
      any longer and decided to try their luck surving the onslaught from the
      "INSERT ROMAN-LIKE EMPIRE HERE" empire.

    <h2>Landscape of Midabour Peaks</h2>
    <p>
      The midabour peaks are a tough and rugged landscape to survive in. Towards
      the top there is extreme cold temperatures and lots of snow. Throughout
      the land there are natural hotsprings that melt the snow around them.
      Villages tend to be built around the ones that are outside however there
      are plenty that are secluded in caves and other such natural landmarks as
      well. If a member of the Drakornar people is ever in danger of freezing to
      death they can drink some of Kyzeot's blood to give themselves an
      inner-fire to keep themselves alive. Here is an excerpt of someone who
      tried a vial of Kyzeot's blood for the first time...

        >"Immediately after drinking the exotic ichor a warmth came over me, the
        kind of which I had never experienced before. It's as if my senses
        melded with the universe beyond and all my perceptions became clearer. I
        was one with the dragon and the dragon was one with me. My breath
        belonged to him as his mine."</em
